# CartoCrayon

CartoCrayon is an experimental tool for visualizing geographic data. You import geojson feature with data properties, use CartoCrayon to style the features the way you want them, and then export geojson annotated with style properties and an embed code for displaying it with Leaflet on any web page.

CartoCrayon is in very early development: you probably don't want to use it yet.
